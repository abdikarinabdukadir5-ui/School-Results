FINAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR VS CODE
==============================

You had a "PathError" because your Node.js version is very new. I have fixed the code to support it.

HERE ARE THE EXACT STEPS TO RUN IT:

1. Stop any running servers (Click the trash icon in the VS Code terminal).
2. Open the "server/server.js" file and make sure my recent fix is there.
3. Open a NEW Terminal (`Ctrl + ~` or `Terminal -> New Terminal`).
4. Type this EXACT command and hit Enter:

   node server/server.js

5. Wait for it to say:
   "Server running on http://localhost:3001"

6. Open that link in your browser.

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If it says "Error: Cannot find module", run this command first:
  npm install && cd server && npm install && cd ..
