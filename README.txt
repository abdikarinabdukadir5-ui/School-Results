HOW TO RUN (V3 - SINGLE SERVER)
==============================

We have simplified everything into ONE command.

1. Open VS Code in this folder.
2. Open the Terminal (`Ctrl + ~`).
3. Run this single command:

   node server/server.js

4. Open your browser to:
   http://localhost:3001

That's it! The Backend and the Website are now running together on the same port.

(If dependencies are missing, run `npm install` and `cd server && npm install` once).
